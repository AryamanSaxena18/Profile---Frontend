# Project Statement

## Project Title
Profile Card UI Design

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a modern profile card interface using only HTML5 and CSS3, while applying core layout and styling principles of frontend development.

## Project Description
This project is a static Profile Card UI that displays user information in a clean and visually structured format. The card includes:

- A header background section
- A centered circular profile image
- User name and profession
- Social media icons
- Action buttons (Subscribe and Message)

The design focuses on achieving proper alignment, spacing, and balance using modern CSS techniques without the use of JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- SVG Icons
- Boxicons CDN

## Key Concepts Implemented
- Relative and Absolute positioning
- Horizontal centering using `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`
- Flexbox for horizontal and vertical alignment
- Removing default browser spacing from lists
- Aligning SVG icons with text elements
- Creating hover effects for improved user interaction
- Structuring clean and readable CSS code

## Skills Demonstrated
- UI layout structuring
- Responsive alignment handling
- Styling and spacing control
- Understanding of CSS box model
- Visual hierarchy and component design

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, a deeper understanding of layout management and alignment techniques was achieved. It improved practical knowledge of Flexbox, positioning strategies, and UI structuring while reinforcing clean coding practices.

## Future Enhancements
- Making the layout fully responsive
- Adding smooth animations and transitions
- Implementing JavaScript interactivity (e.g., like button toggle)
- Creating a dark mode version
- Enhancing accessibility

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to build a structured and visually appealing UI component using fundamental frontend technologies. It reflects an understanding of modern CSS layout techniques and clean design implementation.
